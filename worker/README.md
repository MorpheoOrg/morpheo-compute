Morpheo: Compute Workers
========================

Compute workers prepare and execute containerized machine learning workflows.

It retrieves tasks from a (distributed) broker, pulls the *problem workflow*
container (that describes how training and prediction tasks are executed and
evaluated) and runs the training/prediction tasks on the network-isolated
*submission* container. Training tasks' performance increase is also evaluated
and sent to the orchestrator.

The specifications of the containers ran by compute is documented
[here](https://morpheoorg.github.io/morpheo/).

Examples *problem workflow* and *submission* containers can be found
[here](https://github.com/MorpheoOrg/hypnogram-wf).

CLI Arguments
-------------

```
Usage of ./target/compute-worker:

  -channel string
    	The channel to use (default: compute) (default "compute")
  -lookup-interval duration
    	The interval at which nsqlookupd will be polled (default 5s)
  -lookup-urls value
    	The URLs of the Nsqlookupd instances to fetch our topics from.
```

### TODO

* Retry policies for our tasks depending on the source of the error
