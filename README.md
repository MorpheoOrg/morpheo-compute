Morpheo-Compute: a container-based ML task queue
=================================================

Compute aims at providing a machine learning HTTP API and asynchronous task
queue that runs training and prediction jobs (possibly other jobs) in an
asynchronous way. It is part of the [Morpheo project](https://morpheoorg.github.io/morpheo/modules/introduction.html).
